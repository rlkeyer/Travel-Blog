# Travel Blog

#### Introduction

This is a sample Travel Blog website.  All of the content is currently on a single page and can be accessed through the index.html file.  I used flexbox grids for the PLACES TO GO and TRAVEL TIPS sections with multiple media queries to make the site responsive.  I implemented navigation through page anchors with smooth scrolling using jQuery.  I also used jQuery to change the text of the Submit input when it is clicked.

#### Places to go

This is a flexbox grid with six categories that will eventually link to pages with detailed information and posts about each destination.  Eventually I could see adding more cells to the grid.

#### Travel tips

Also a flexbox grid that eventually will link to articles and posts about how to save money while traveling, trip ideas, etc.

#### Responsive design

I used several media queries to optimize the site for mobile devices.  The hamburger in the navigation bar (visible on screens of less than 750px) uses a JavaScript function to expand and collapse the mobile navigation menu.
