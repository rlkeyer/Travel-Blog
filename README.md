Travel Blog

This is a sample Travel Blog website.  All of the content is on one page and can be accessed through index.html.  I used flexbox grids for the PLACES TO GO and TRAVEL TIPS sections with multiple media queries to make the site responsive.  I implemented navigation through page anchors with smooth scrolling using jQuery.  I also used jQuery to change the text of the Submit input when it is clicked.
